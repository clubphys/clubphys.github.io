title: First Game Night
---

Today we had our first official game night, at which we played the party game known as [mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)).

Being physicists and astronomers, we found the mathematical theory interesting. Naturally, we applied it to choose how many mafia members there were.

In total, we played probably between 5 and 8 games, some of which we alternated narrators. It was very interesting to see how physicists make up stories on the spot.
