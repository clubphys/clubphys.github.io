### Information

This webpage is intended to keep a record of the goings-on for Physics Club. Here you will find information about upcoming events, what we're doing, and things we intend to do!

### Calendar

You can view the upcoming and past events at our [Google Calendar](/calendar/).

### Who are we?

We've got roughly 20-25 members right now, and we're always looking for more! [You can sign up any time here](https://goo.gl/forms/Xt2EpCevllDZg0zC3). You don't need to be a major, you just need to be interested in physics and/or astronomy.

### Leadership

We've got a group of talented, budding physicists and astronomers running this club. Some of them have decided they want to help develop a community of students in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UGA. You can find a list of who's who on our [leadership page](/leadership/).
